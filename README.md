# Gas optimization technics 

This project demonstrates a certain number of gas optimizations technics that can help you save some gas during deployment and while users are interacting with your smart contracts. 


Here are the technics discussed in this repo: 
- [Packing variables](https://github.com/Merdi-kim/gas-optimisation-technics/tree/master/contracts/packing-variables) 
- [Using custom errors](https://github.com/Merdi-kim/gas-optimisation-technics/tree/master/contracts/custom-errors) 
- [Accessing arrays in a loop operation](https://github.com/Merdi-kim/gas-optimisation-technics/tree/master/contracts/loops-operation-and-array) 
- [Usage of mappings vs arrays](https://github.com/Merdi-kim/gas-optimisation-technics/tree/master/contracts/mappings-vs-arrays) 
- [Reusing modifiers](https://github.com/Merdi-kim/gas-optimisation-technics/tree/master/contracts/reused-modifier) 
- [Use of "unchecked" inside the loop definition](https://github.com/Merdi-kim/gas-optimisation-technics/tree/master/contracts/uncheck-usage) 

⚠️⚠️ This guide doesn't contain all the technics but only some of the common ones that you should not miss.
This documentation is constantly changing and new technics are getting discovered. If I missed something in this documentation, kindly add that by opening a pull request. I'll be happy to merge it.
