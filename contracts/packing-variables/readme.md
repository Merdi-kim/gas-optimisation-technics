# Packing variables
In solidity, every variable takes up a certain amount of space, and space is allocated in chunks of 256bits. This means that if you have a variable that takes less than one chunk of storage(256bits), it is possible to compliment another variable(if that variable exists) so that the whole chunk of storage can be filled. In order for that to happen, you’ll need to put the two variables side by side. For example, if we have two variables `uint64 firstNumber` and `uint64 secondNumber`, the order in which these two are placed can determine whether they’ll take one storage slot or two different storage slots. The more storage slot they take, the more gas it will cost.
