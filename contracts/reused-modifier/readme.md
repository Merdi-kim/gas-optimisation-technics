# If the modifier is reused, consider adding a function
While working with modifiers, we need to keep in mind that the code gets copied everywhere the modifier is used. For the case that a modifier is used just once, we might not see an increase in gas cost. But if we get a modifier that gets reused let’s say 5times. In that case, we’re going to have that modifier’s logic copied in 5 different places which bring redundancy. To avoid that redundancy, we can put our modifier logic inside a function and call that function inside our modifier. This way, we’re going to have a pointer to that function containing the logic every time that modifier is used instead of having the logic of the modifier copied everywhere it is involved.
