# Loops and storage
Most of the time, while dealing with loops in solidity, we loop through an array that is in `storage` or we retrieve elements from `storage mapping`. The other scenario is when we’re writing to storage every time while looping. This operation can quickly become very expensive. The optimal solution is to copy the content that is in storage and load that in memory then, later on, rewrite it to the storage if needed. Let’s just think about an array of balances in our smart contract. If we want to increment all those balances by 2ETH(giveaway), we would need to loop through those balances and increment their values by 2. Since these balances are stored in `storage`, if we try to read them all from storage and modify their values directly, this operation can become very very expensive. What we could do in this scenario is to copy that array into memory and perform all the actions on the copied array, then at the end, we can rewrite the result to the array in storage which will take only one operation and save us a ton of gas.
