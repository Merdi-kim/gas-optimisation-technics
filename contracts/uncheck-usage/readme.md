# Use “Unchecked”
Solidity provides a set of built-in methods that help to check for integer overflow and underflow. This approach makes it safe for us to work with integers with no worries because solidity does the check for us. But in some scenarios, especially in loops, these checks become a little bit unnecessary since we implement our own logic of checks inside of the For loop. Now, we have two checks that do the same thing but work at the same time which can be gas-consuming. To stop the solidity built-in check, we need to use the *unchecked* keyword that tells solidity not to check for overflow in that specific case. But why do we tell solidity not to perform the check? The reason is, that we’re implementing the check logic inside of our own for loop.
